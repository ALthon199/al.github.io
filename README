API KEY USAGE AND FUNCTIONALITY:

When the website initially loads, a function immediately calls the NASA API, getting
a JSON file with all the images/video data. When stars are cicked and/or the Surprise
me button in the bottom right is clicked, this fetch is done again by querying with 
a random date. This code does require a NASA API key, this can be simply done
by https://api.nasa.gov/ and signing up for one. Once you have it, create a config.js file
and add

window.NASA_CONFIG = {
  API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY",
};

NOTE: There's also a DEMO_KEY given by NASA which is currrently being used for temporary
exploration if an API key isn't given. THis will let the widget still function, however, its only
up to 50 requests a day.
