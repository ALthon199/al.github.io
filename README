API KEY USAGE AND FUNCTIONALITY:

When the website initially loads, a function immediately calls the NASA API, getting
a JSON file with all the images/video data. When stars are cicked and/or the Surprise
me button in the bottom right is clicked, this fetch is done again by querying with 
a random date. This code does require a NASA API key, this can be simply done
by https://api.nasa.gov/ and signing up for one. Once you have it, create a config.js file
and add

window.NASA_CONFIG = {
  API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY",
};

The website will still load, just without the functionality.
