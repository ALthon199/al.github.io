   Initiated what I wanted to implement to the AI

2. "I would like the widget to replace the background"
   A major website change.

3. "It should be the background for all website pages"
   Helped ensure that this change was across all pages

4. "could you now dim the image"
    Massively improved website design and overall look.

5. "could you add little pop ups on the background for people to click to change backgrounds"
   Created simple interactive elements across the website, as well as a good design.

6. "Ensure the stars are not placed above text, projects cards, 
    or anything besides the current space background. Ensure the stars 
    are still clickable after."
   Really good quality check, fixed a lot of small bugs.
